# Weather API 
**Python -> C# Conversion Project**

Original project was made with Python using Tkinter for the GUI and OpenWeatherMap API. Converted, I ended up using WinForms for the UI. I used AI to assist me in completing this, with DeepSeek for the bigger chunks of code & GH Copilot to refine.
